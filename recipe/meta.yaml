  summary: |
    The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for developing new
    climate diagnostics. CDP allows for a modular implementation of the
    components required for running diagnostics. The design of CDP consists
    of modules to handle the user-defined parameters, metrics, provenance,
    file I/O, output of results and algorithms for calculating the diagnostics.
